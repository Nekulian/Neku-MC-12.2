You may not charge people to get access to any modified versions that are made. Money through donations such as Patreon is fine, so long as they are purely optional donations.

You may not charge people for individual assets from this pack and/or claim them as your own.

You may not redistribute non-modified versions of the pack anywhere.

You may not use custom-created assets from this pack and claim them as your own (this includes scripts, textures, etc). You may use scripts from this pack as an education tool to learn Zenscript, CraftTweaker, etc, but do not copy entire scripts, artwork, etc.

All modified/spin-off versions of this pack must abide by this same license.
