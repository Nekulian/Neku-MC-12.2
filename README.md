These instructions are for MultiMC but should largely be the same on other launchers
# How to install (for newbies)
1. Download the modpack using [this link](https://github.com/Nekulian/Neku-MC-12.2/archive/refs/heads/main.zip)
2. Create an instance using version ``1.12.2`` and ``Forge 14.23.5.2855``
3. extract the files from the zip file into the ``.minecraft`` folder in your instance

everytime you update the modpack, make sure to empty the ``mods`` and ``config`` folder otherwise mods that arent intended to be used could end up activate.

# How to install (for pros)
1. Create an instance using version ``1.12.2`` and ``Forge 14.23.5.2855``
2. Clone the repository into the ``.minecraft`` folder in your instance 

If your git manager cannot clone the repository into the folder, you should be able to move the files out from the folder, clone the repo in, then move the files back in, the ``.gitignore`` is configured accordingly
