# How to install this strangely formatted modpack [[MultiMC](https://multimc.org/#Download)/[CurseForge](https://download.curseforge.com/)]
1. Download the modpack using [this link](https://github.com/Nekulian/Neku-MC-12.2/archive/refs/heads/main.zip)
2. Create an instance using ``MC 1.12.2`` and ``Forge 14.23.5.2855``
3. extract the files from the zip file into ``.minecraft`` folder in your instance

### Important 
everytime you update the modpack, make sure to empty the ``mods`` folder otherwise mods that arent being used could end up activate.

If your launcher wont work/you have any further questions, then feel free to speak with me me over at the [Discord Server](discord.gg/cctdze2fkz)
